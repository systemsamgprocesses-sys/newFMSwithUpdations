# Objections Visibility Update

## Date: 2025-10-18

### Enhancement: See All Your Objections

Users can now see **ALL** objections they're involved with:

1. ✅ **Objections I Raised** - Your own objections
2. ✅ **For My Review** - Objections assigned to you for review
3. ✅ **Tagged** - Objections where you're tagged for visibility

---

## What Changed

### Backend (Code.gs)

#### `getObjections()` Function:
Now returns objections where the user is:
- **Raised By** - User created the objection
- **Routed To** - User is assigned as reviewer
- **Tagged** - User is tagged for visibility

**New Fields Returned:**
- `isRaisedByMe` - Boolean flag if user raised it
- `isRoutedToMe` - Boolean flag if user is the reviewer
- `isTagged` - Boolean flag if user is tagged

```javascript
// Example response:
{
  objectionId: "OBJ123456",
  taskDescription: "Complete documentation",
  status: "Pending",
  isRaisedByMe: true,      // I raised this
  isRoutedToMe: false,     // Not assigned to me
  isTagged: false          // Not tagged
}
```

---

### Frontend (Dashboard.tsx)

#### Visual Indicators:
Each objection now shows clear badges indicating your relationship:

| Badge | Meaning | Color |
|-------|---------|-------|
| 📝 I Raised This | You created this objection | Purple |
| ⚖️ For My Review | Assigned to you for review | Green |
| 🏷️ Tagged | You're tagged for visibility | Blue |

#### Action Buttons:
Smart logic determines who can take action:
- ✅ **Can Take Action**: Reviewer (isRoutedToMe = true)
- ❌ **Cannot Take Action**: 
  - Person who raised it (isRaisedByMe = true)
  - Tagged users (isTagged = true only)

This prevents you from reviewing your own objections!

#### Section Header:
Updated to clearly indicate what's shown:
```
My Objections
Includes objections you raised, for your review, and where you're tagged
```

## User Experience

### Before:
- ❌ Could only see objections routed to you for review
- ❌ Couldn't see objections you raised
- ❌ No clear indication of your role

### After:
- ✅ See all objections you're involved with
- ✅ Clear badges showing your relationship
- ✅ Track your own objections from raise to resolution
- ✅ Stay informed when tagged
- ✅ Can't accidentally review your own objection

- [ ] Verify you cannot take action on it
- [ ] See when it gets reviewed and resolved

### As Reviewer:
- [ ] See objections routed to you with "⚖️ For My Review" badge

- [ ] Verify you can view but not take action

### Multiple Roles:

## API Response Format

### Before:
```javascript
{
  objectionId: "OBJ123",
  status: "Pending",
  isTagged: true  // Only this flag
}
```

### After:
```javascript
{
  objectionId: "OBJ123",
  status: "Pending",
  isRaisedByMe: false,   // New
  isRoutedToMe: true,    // New
  isTagged: true
}
```
