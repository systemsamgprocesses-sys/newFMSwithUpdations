# Multi-Doer Task Completion & All Tasks Display Enhancement

## Overview
This update ensures that tasks with multiple doers (assignees) require completion from ALL doers before being marked as "Done", and enhances the All Tasks section for Super Admin with additional context information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Multi-Doer Task Completion Logic

#### Backend (Code.gs)
- **Location:** `updateTaskStatus` function (lines 1798-1854)
- **Changes:**
  - Added validation to prevent users from completing a task they've already completed (lines 1818-1825)
  - Task only marks as "Done" when ALL assigned doers have completed their part
  - Individual completions are tracked in `Completed_By_Users` column (column 21 in FMS_PROGRESS sheet)
  - Status remains "In Progress" until all doers complete
  - Next step creation only happens when ALL doers complete

#### Frontend (Dashboard.tsx)
- **Multi-WHO Completion Status Display:**
  - Mobile view (lines 1932-1970): Shows completion badge with count (e.g., "2/3 completed")
  - Desktop table view (lines 2203-2217): Shows completion count in compact format
  - Lists who has completed (green badge) and who is pending (gray badge)
  
- **Prevent Duplicate Completion:**
  - Mobile view (lines 2006-2032): Users who completed their part see "You have completed your part. Waiting for others."
  - Desktop view (lines 2224-2238): Shows "Completed" status instead of Complete button
  - Complete button is hidden for users who already completed their part

### 2. All Tasks Section Enhancement (Super Admin)

#### Backend Updates
- **Location:** `allTasksForAdmin` useMemo in Dashboard.tsx (lines 473-556)
- **Changes:**
  - For FMS tasks: Extracts "Previous step completed by" information from the previous task in the project
  - For Normal tasks: Includes "Assigned by" (GIVEN BY) information

#### Frontend Display
- **UnifiedTask Interface:** Added `previousStepCompletedBy` field (line 26)

- **Mobile Card View (lines 1914-1930):**
  - Normal Tasks: Shows "Assigned by: [name]" in blue
  - FMS Tasks: Shows "Previous step completed by: [name]" in purple

- **Desktop Table View (lines 2184-2200):**
  - Normal Tasks: Shows "By: [name]" in blue under assignee
  - FMS Tasks: Shows "Prev: [name]" in purple under assignee

## How It Works

### Multi-Doer Task Flow:
1. **Assignment:** Task is assigned to multiple users (e.g., ["User1", "User2", "User3"])
2. **First Completion:** User1 completes → Status stays "In Progress", completionsByUser tracks User1's completion
3. **Second Completion:** User2 completes → Status still "In Progress", both User1 and User2 marked as completed
4. **Final Completion:** User3 completes → Status changes to "Done", next step is created

### All Tasks Display:
- **For Normal Tasks:** Super Admin sees who assigned the task (the "GIVEN BY" person)
- **For FMS Tasks:** Super Admin sees who completed the previous step in the workflow

## Benefits
1. **Accountability:** Ensures all assigned team members complete their part
2. **Transparency:** Clear visibility of who has and hasn't completed multi-doer tasks
3. **Context:** Super Admin can see task assignment chain and workflow progression
4. **Prevention:** Users cannot accidentally mark a task complete twice

## Testing Recommendations
1. Create a task with multiple doers
2. Have one doer complete it → verify status is "In Progress"
3. Have remaining doers complete → verify status changes to "Done"
4. Try to complete again as a user who already completed → verify error message
5. Check All Tasks section as Super Admin → verify assigner/previous step info displays correctly
